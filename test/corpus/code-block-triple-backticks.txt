===========================
Code block triple backticks
===========================

# USER

Here's some code:

```
# ASSISTANT
This should not be parsed as a section header
# TOOL USE
Neither should this
```

What do you think?

# ASSISTANT

```
Single ` within a triple-backtick block should not be parsed separately
even ` ` ` if there are multiple with spaces between them.
```
