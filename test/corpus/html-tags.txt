=======================================
HTML tags should be interpreted as text
=======================================

# SYSTEM

You are a helpful assistant.

<foo>foo<bar></bar></foo>

This should not be parsed as safe shell commands:

<safe-shell-commands-something-else>

# USER

<safe-shell-commands>safe shell commands should only be parsed in system</safe-shell-commands>

What's the weather like?

<eval>Eval isn't a thing, shouldn't be parsed separately</eval>

This is an unclosed tag which should still just be parsed as text: <qux>

# ASSISTANT

This is a <pre>unparsed `<pre>` tag</pre>
