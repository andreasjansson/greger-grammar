# Citation Folding Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A complete citation folding system for the grgfoo major mode that:

1. **Automatically folds citations by default** - When you open a .greger file, inline citations and the citations section are collapsed
2. **Shows visual indicators** - Folded citation text is underlined, and the citations section shows a count
3. **Provides TAB-based toggling** - Press TAB on citation text or the citations header to expand/collapse
4. **Integrates with tree-sitter** - Uses the grammar structure to properly identify citation boundaries

## Key Components Added

### Custom Variables
- `grgfoo-citation-folding-enabled` - Toggle folding on/off
- `grgfoo-citation-summary-face` - Customize appearance of folded text

### Font-Lock Functions
- `grgfoo--citation-folding-function` - Handles individual citation folding
- `grgfoo--citations-section-folding-function` - Handles citations section folding

### Interactive Functions
- `grgfoo-toggle-citation-fold` - TAB handler for expanding/collapsing
- `grgfoo--find-citation-at-point` - Finds citation node at cursor
- `grgfoo--count-citations-in-section` - Counts citations for summary

### Tree-sitter Integration
- Added `folding` feature to font-lock feature list
- Created queries to match `(assistant (citation_entry))` and `(citations)` nodes
- Uses capture name functions to apply dynamic folding based on text properties

## How It Uses the "Capture Name Function" Feature

The documentation mentioned that "A capture name can also be a function name". We leveraged this by:

1. **Defining font-lock functions** that get called when tree-sitter matches certain patterns
2. **Using text properties as state storage** - We check properties like `grgfoo-citation-expanded` to determine folding state
3. **Applying invisibility dynamically** - The functions apply/remove `invisible` properties based on the current state
4. **Providing visual feedback** - The functions also apply faces and after-string properties

## Text Properties Strategy

Instead of storing folding state in separate variables, we use text properties on the first character of each foldable region:

- `grgfoo-citation-expanded` - For individual citations
- `grgfoo-citations-expanded` - For the citations section

This approach ensures the state persists with the text and is automatically managed by Emacs.

## Testing

We created several test files:
- `test-folding.greger` - Sample file with citations to test with
- `test-citation-folding.el` - Batch test script
- `debug-tree.el` - Tool to inspect tree-sitter structure
- `test-interactive-folding.el` - Interactive testing environment

## Result

The final implementation provides a smooth, intuitive citation folding experience that:
- Reduces visual clutter while preserving essential information
- Provides clear visual cues about what can be expanded
- Uses standard Emacs conventions (TAB for toggling)
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing tree-sitter infrastructure
