## SYSTEM:

### Safe shell commands

<safe-shell-commands>
bash build.sh
tree-sitter generate && tree-sitter parse debug.greger
tree-sitter generate && tree-sitter parse -d pretty debug.greger
tree-sitter generate && tree-sitter parse debug_comprehensive.greger
tree-sitter generate && tree-sitter parse -d pretty debug_comprehensive.greger
emacs --batch -l debug-test.el
tree-sitter parse -d pretty test_simple.greger
</safe-shell-commands>

IMPORTANT: Don't run any other shell commands than the safe shell commands since I will be afk and not able to approve use of unsafe shell commands. Re-use existing debug scripts etc so you don't have to run unsafe shell commands. If you try to run unsafe commands you'll get stuck waiting for approval indefinitely. Use replicate-file with existing debug and test files instead of creating new debug and test files.

### Problem statement

I'm working on a custom tree-sitter grammar for the markdown-like format described in ~/projects/greger.el/test/test-greger-parser.el. When parsing the greger syntax, it should return the elisp forms in test-greger-parser.el. Effectively I want to replace the underlying implementation of `greger-parser-parse-dialog-messages-only` with a tree-sitter based grammar.

I want to work on the grammar in isolation here in a clean repo before integrating into greger.el.

### Current state

* I have installed the tree-sitter CLI and run `tree-sitter init`.
* I have a boilerplate for the elisp postprocessing code in greger-tree-sitter.el.
* I have ported over the test cases from ~/projects/greger.el/test/test-greger-parser.el to test-all-test-cases.el

### Instructions

IMPORTANT: Any time you modify the grammar.js, run build.sh to update the generated treesit shared object.

Make sure you parse citations in the grammar. Parsing in elisp is much slower than parsing in tree-sitter.

Read test-all-test-cases.el and read all the test cases to understand what's expected. Below are some detailed notes explaining the behavior I expect.

#### Citation parsing logic

If `<cite>...</cite>` is encountered anywhere on a line, it starts parsing a new "citations_with_text" object. The content inside `<cite>...</cite>` should be a "text" field on the "citations_with_text" object. After `</cite>` you should assume just whitespace until you encounter `## CITATIONS:` at the start of a new line. Then you should parse those citations and place each entry as an "entry" field on the "citations_with_text" object. If you encounter a `## CITATIONS:` when you're not parsing "citations_with_text", make a new "citations_without_text" object and add the "entry"s to that.

#### Tool content

Tool use, server tool use, and tool result blocks have parameter content and result content wrapped in
```
<tool.XXX>
...
</tool.XXX>
```

The XXX needs to match in the open and close tag. Anything inside tool use content should be unparsed, returned verbatim (even if there are nested `<tool.XXX>` tags, comments, etc.

#### HTML comments

HTML comments should not be returned, and should be ignored.

#### Code blocks

Code blocks are represented as in markdown, with single or triple backquotes. Anything inside code blocks should be unparsed, returned verbatim, including `<tool.XXX>` tags, etc.

#### Safe shell commands

Safe shell commands can only be present under the `## SYSTEM:` heading, and should be returned from the parser as a separate entity to the other system content. Safe shell commands look like this:

```
## SYSTEM:

bla bla bla

<safe-shell-commands>
command1
this is command2
etc.
</safe-shell-commands>

foo bar baz
```

#### Tool use, server tool use, and server tool result

These all have fixed formats, and I want the different parts to be returned as separate entities from the parser.

For example

```
## SERVER TOOL USE:

Name: web_search
ID: srvtoolu_01WYG3ziw53XMcoyKL4XcZmE

### query

<tool.srvtoolu_01WYG3ziw53XMcoyKL4XcZmE>
claude shannon birth date
</tool.srvtoolu_01WYG3ziw53XMcoyKL4XcZmE>
```

should return name, id, and query as separate entities.

### Resources

Here's a guide to using tree-sitter: https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/03/19/lets_create_a_tree-sitter_grammar/ -- you will want to use a custom scanner for the `<tool.XXX>` tags since you'll need to remember the tool ID (in this case `XXX`) of the opening tag, in order to find the closing tag. That cannot be accomplished in grammar.js.

Here are example grammars for a bunch of languages: ~/src/github/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/repos. Make sure you read some of those examples to get inspiration and ideas, especially if you get stuck! Pick a few at random to start with, just to get some ideas.

The HTML grammar is especially interesting: ~/src/github/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/repos/html/grammar.js, and its associated scanner too: ~/src/github/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/repos/html/src/scanner.c -- make sure you read this!

### Next steps

Focus on the parser first:
* Copy the different test case markdown snippets from the test into debug.greger
* Run `tree-sitter parse -d pretty debug.greger` to inspect the parse result
* Now and then, read some examples from /Users/andreas/src/github/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/repos to get ideas and inspiration
* Repeat until all the markdown snippets from the test file parse without errors, and have good parse results (e.g. `citations_with_text` work, backticks work, etc.)

Once the parser works, then work on greger-tree-sitter.el

## USER:

Go!

And very important: Remember to not run any other shell commands than the safe shell commands since I will be afk and not able to approve use of unsafe shell commands. Re-use existing debug scripts etc so you don't have to run unsafe shell commands. If you try to run unsafe commands you'll get stuck waiting for approval indefinitely.
