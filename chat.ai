IMPORTANT: Don't run any other shell commands than the safe shell commands since I will be afk and not able to approve use of unsafe shell commands. Re-use existing debug scripts etc so you don't have to run unsafe shell commands. If you try to run unsafe commands you'll get stuck waiting for approval indefinitely.

Here's a guide to using tree-sitter: https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/03/19/lets_create_a_tree-sitter_grammar/ (definitely read this if you'll touch the custom scanner!)

Here are example grammars for a bunch of languages: /Users/andreas/src/github/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/repos. Read some of those examples to get inspiration and ideas.

## USER:


I want to make a custom tree-sitter grammar for the markdown-like format described in ~/projects/greger.el/test/test-greger-parser.el. When parsing the greger syntax, it should return the elisp forms in test-greger-parser.el. Effectively I want to replace the underlying implementation of `greger-parser-parse-dialog-messages-only` with a tree-sitter based grammar.

I want to work on the grammar in isolation here in a clean repo before integrating into greger.el.

I have installed the tree-sitter CLI and run `tree-sitter init`.

Make sure you read the elisp and go examples so you see what complex parsing looks like. Also make sure you read https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/03/19/lets_create_a_tree-sitter_grammar/

I've ported over the test cases from test-greger-parser.el to test-all-greger-cases.el

The tests are passing. But the elisp code is really complex. Parsing in elisp is much slower than parsing in tree-sitter.

So, change it such that the parser handles citation logic.

If `<cite>...</cite>` is encountered anywhere on a line, it starts parsing a new "citations_with_text" object. The content inside `<cite>...</cite>` should be a "text" field on the "citations_with_text" object. After `</cite>` you should assume just whitespace until you encounter `## CITATIONS:` at the start of a new line. Then you should parse those citations and place each entry as an "entry" field on the "citations_with_text" object.

If you encounter a `## CITATIONS:` when you're not parsing "citations_with_text", make a new "citations_without_text" object and add the "entry"s to that.

That should make the markdown to dialog conversion fairly basic, since cited text should be part of the same content entry as the citations (look at the expected value on line 725 of test-greger-parser.el
